Python scripts used in conjunction with SierraDNA to generate automated notification e-mails.
Created and maintained by Jeremy Goldstein for test purposes only. Use at your own risk.
Not supported by the Minuteman Library Network.

Scripts are run via Windows Task scheduler each morning.

Due to limits in gmail governing how many messages may be generated in bulk, we produce multiple versions of each of these scripts using different ptype to divide up the messages and run them 15 minutes apart.
